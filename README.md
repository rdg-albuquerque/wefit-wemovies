# WeMovies

Hi WeFit team! I hope you like the work I did for this app!

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## API

You don't need to run a separated server to use the mocked API. It can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/products](http://localhost:3000/api/products). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/products.ts`.
